# Watchdog-Timer-IP
It is basically a timer circuit which monitors the processor continuously. The Watchdog timer ip runs the inbuilt timer and if it reaches a particular value then it resets the processor. The IP assumes that there is some software anomalies happening in the processor and it resets the processor. To Avoid this, the processor has to reset the IP continuosly.
